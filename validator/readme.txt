This folder contains a python script which can be used to validate your solutions. You need to put the .py files included here in the same folder as your instance and solution.

This folder contains an example instance, together with a valid solution for this instance. You can use these to test that the validator works on your computer.

To validate instance00, execute the validator with arguments:
python Validate.py --instance instance00.txt --solution solution00.txt


Also try the validator with a wrong solution and see what happens!
